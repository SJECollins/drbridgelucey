                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Bridge and I’m a Chartered Counselling Psychologist with the PSI. I qualified from the
                    Doctorate
                    in Counselling
                    Psychology from Trinity College in 2018. I also have a Higher Diploma in Psychology from Trinity
                    College
                    and a degree in
                    Visual Arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked with hundreds of clients in my career across different services including youth
                    services,
                    hospitals,
                    community mental health services, college counselling and forensic settings. I am an LGBTQIA+
                    friendly
                    practitioner and
                    have worked with people across the gender, sexuality and neurotype spectrums and understand the
                    impact
                    that this may
                    have on their lives. I have a particular interest in working with young adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For most people, their struggles with mental health are completely understandable reactions to
                    difficult circumstances
                    they have experienced throughout their life. That may include unhelpful messages that they have
                    learned from social,
                    cultural or family systems, traumatic events, difficult relationships, marginalisation, or ongoing
                    stressors. Many of
                    the things often classed as symptoms are an understandable means of coping that we have used to
                    protect ourselves along
                    the way, but may now be causing us difficulties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work with people to better understand these ways of coping and where they came from, as well as
                    healing the difficult
                    emotions which can keep us stuck and repeating old patterns. I am an integrative practitioner and
                    adapt
                    how I work
                    depending on the needs and goals of the client, within my areas of expertise. I work with my clients
                    from a place of
                    curiosity, creativity, and openness, acknowledging that you are the expert in your own experiences,
                    and
                    providing a safe
                    and non-judgmental place to begin to heal and live a life in line with your personal values.
