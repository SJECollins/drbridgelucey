              I see clients for a range of difficulties including relationship
              issues, anxiety, people who are perfectionistic or people
              pleasing, low self-worth, life transitions, loss, issues with
              identity or sexuality, low mood, or people feeling stuck or
              overwhelmed.

          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              At most points during the year, I have a waiting list. The best
              way to get put on the waiting list is to get in touch via the
              contact form and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              I ask for 48 hours notice if you cannot attend your next
              appointment. Cancellations later than this will be charged a
              session fee.

              Therapy can be shorter or longer-term depending on your goals and
              the complexity of the difficulties at hand. We will discuss
              setting goals and realistic expectations at the beginning of our
              work together.

            <p>
              Most people can get a little bit of a sense of me from my areas of
              interest and my website but really the only way to know for sure
              is to book in for a session. Usually people have a good sense of
              whether or not I am the right fit for them within the first
              session or two.

          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              My waitlist length changes depending on the time of year, with
              autumn and winter months tending to be busier for new referrals
              than the summertime. There is a higher demand for early morning,
              lunchtime and evening appointments, so wait times for these is
              generally longer. If someone is more flexible with when they can
              attend, I can usually see them sooner than someone who can only
              attend at a specific time. The best way to know is to get in touch
              and ask.

          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              For a variety of reasons both clinical and practical, I offer
              weekly sessions. Research indicates that frequency of sessions is
              a predictor of sustained outcomes. The building of the therapeutic
              relationship, establishing goals, gaining and maintaining momentum
              and acquiring skills takes a much longer time and is likely to be
              less effective when sessions are attended less frequently.

          <button class="accordion">Do you work with neurodivergence?</button>
          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              Yes! I have a lot of experience working in a neuro-affirming way
              with people, especially late-identified neurodivergence. People
              often come to me for support with different aspects of
              neurodivergence such as unmasking or dealing with burnout.
              <br />
              I work in a non-pathologising, strengths-focused way, with the
              knowledge that neurodivergence is a difference rather than a
              deficit (although many people feel a lot of stress and can be
              disabled by virtue of trying to fit into a world designed for the
              dominant neurotype).

          <button class="accordion">
            I have been told I need a specific type of therapy, can you provide
            this?
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>
              I mostly work with person-centred therapy, Compassion Focused
              Therapy and Emotion Focused Therapy, though I have training in
              several other modalities.
              <br />
              I work with people over the first few sessions to establish goals
              and then we can decide on how to work to reach these goals
              together. This may be through using one specific type of therapy
              or with aspects of more than one therapy (i.e. an integrative
              approach).
