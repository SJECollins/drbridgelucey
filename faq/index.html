                    <p>Therapy can be shorter or longer-term depending on your goals and the complexity of the
                        difficulties at hand. We will
                        discuss setting goals and realistic expectations at the beginning of our work together.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Can you diagnose me with a specific disorder?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Sometimes people find it useful to define what they are struggling with through specific
                        diagnostic labels, such as
                        personality disorders. While some find this useful, my way of working is to explore why people
                        think/feel/behave the way
                        they do and understand better why that came to be in the context of their life experience. This
                        is called a
                        psychological formulation. I tend to use psychological formulation more than clinical
                        diagnostics in my work with
                        people.

                        I am currently not doing ASD or ADHD assessments but if you want support pre- or
                        post-identification or explore where
                        neurodivergence fits within your understanding of yourself (or your difficulties), I am able to
                        help.

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Most people can get a little bit of a sense of me from my areas of interest and my website but
                        really the only way to
                        know for sure is to book in for a session. Usually people have a good sense of whether or not I
                        am the right fit for
                        them within the first session or two.</p>
